USAGE: 
Connect the knob to a Windows computer via a USB cable once it's connected you need to flash it with the latest version of CircuitPython, then just simply copy and paste all the files from this repository and you're done ;-)

FAQ:

1)Do I need to know Python to use this sample code?

2)What this code does to my knob?

3)Is this code customizable?

ANSWERS:
1)No you don't need to you any programming language to use this sample code, you can just copy and paste all the files to your knob. If the knob isn't working correctly, try reconnecting the knob using a USB cable. If there is still a problem, contact me here on GitHub by posting an issue.
