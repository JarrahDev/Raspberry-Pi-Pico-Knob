USAGE: 
Connect the knob to a Windows computer via a USB cable once it's connected you need to flash it with the latest version of CircuitPython, then just simply copy and paste all the files from this repository and you're done ;-)

FAQ:

1)Do I need to know Python to use this sample code?

2)What this code does to my knob?

3)Is this code customizable?

ANSWERS:
1)No you don't need to you any programming language to use this sample code, you can just copy and paste all the files to your knob. If the knob isn't working correctly, try reconnecting the knob using a USB cable. If there is still a problem, contact me here on GitHub by posting an issue. 

2)This code has 3 basic modes --> 1st is Volume 
2nd is screen brightness and the 3rd one emulates the left and right arrow keys (very useful while editing a video/audio in editor/DAW as well as rewinding or fast-forwarding video/audio). 

3)Yes this code is fully customizable and shareable (you can mention me but it is not required) There are even some customizable parts of the code. For example, you can set a long press to any keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + delete or win + r, or even custom ones like ctrl + alt + f (which is set to by default)
